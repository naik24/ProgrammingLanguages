Working towards my goal of Computer Vision Engineer, I feel there are certain programming languages I should be good at. Although Python comes out on top every time as the most programmable language while writing AI code, some other languages prove to be important especially for Image Processing and Computer Vision.

The programming languages listed below are the ones I have chosen. This repository contains snippets for each of these languages.

- Python 🐍
- C++ ⚛
- MATLAB 📊

❗ I'm still in the process of developing this repo and my GitHub profile. It's a work in progress. Wish me luck!
